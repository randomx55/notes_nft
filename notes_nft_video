In this video, I show you how to use the Metaplex tools and the Solana CLI to upload your generated NFT art collection to the Solana blockchain. Hope you enjoy the video.

Set the environment:
solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com

The important commands:
npx ts-node js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-cli.ts upload ./assets --env devnet --keypair (PATH)

npx ts-node js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-cli.ts create_candy_machine --env devnet --keypair (PATH) 

npx ts-node js/packages/cli/src/candy-machine-cli.ts update_candy_machine --keypair (PATH) --price 1 --date "19 Oct 2021 00:00:00 EST"

Note: for the main net you want to replace all instances of "devnet" with "mainnet-beta".

Also when you are done just run "yarn build" to build the app that you can host on a website.
